Processing was used for the AI since a recreation of the Atari Game 'Asteroid' was used and using visualization in games is easy using Processing which means you will need Processing to run the program. The AI Trains via evolutions from different species during each generation. Rewards are based on the score achieved as well as rewarding complex behaviour in order to augment new nodes. Species that are considered good allows mutations to appear which improves the new species while stale species, those that perform poorly are killed off. This promotes complex behaviour as well as higher scores. 

It starts of without knowing anything and eventually the AI 'learns' which behaviour are good as well as correcting bad behaviour. Eventually, the AI will be dodging the asteroids while also spinning while simultaneously aiming and shooting at the asteroids to increase its score.
